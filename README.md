### Walkthrough Video

Apologies, Github won't let me embed my file no matter what I do. I have also uploaded it to this repo, but it is not viewable. The following link is unfortunately all I can muster at the moment.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs introduced me to concepts that I needed for the weekly assignment, but I would not say that I felt prepared. It definitely was helpful to learn the importance of each different filetype, but beyond the rudimentary everything that I used in my project was either learned through videos, W3 Schools, or Metamate. Specifically I felt unprepared to handle features such as implementing the like button, as well as the shuffle function. Those two features had a plethora of bugs with very obscure solutions that took quite long to discover.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I regret not being able to implement any of the stretch features, so that is the main thing that I would do differently. I would have also added more animations for clicking buttons, as well as generally more responsiveness to user interaction. I also think that it would have been fulfilling to use the real album covers for songs included in the playlists.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During my project demo, I had not yet completed the shuffle implementation or the featured page, so I was a bit lacking in confidence when presenting my work. Despite this, everything went as I expected. All of the features that time had allowed me to complete up to that point were functioning well, and my site was praised for its aesthetics and subtle css details. However, I definitely wish that I would have been able to showcase more functionality during my demo rather than only displaying base level implementations as well as styling.

### Shout out

George, Boris, and Cristobal played huge roles in helping me find confidence in my work, as well as pointing me in the right direction when I encountered similar issues that they had also faced.
